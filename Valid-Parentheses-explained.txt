You need to check if the given string of brackets is valid. A string of brackets is considered valid if:

Every open bracket is matched with a closing bracket of the same type.
Brackets close in the correct order (the last opened bracket must be closed first).
Solution Approach
A stack is an ideal data structure for this problem because it operates on the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to match the most recently opened bracket first.

Steps of the Algorithm
Create a Stack: Use a list in Python to simulate a stack.
Create a Hash Map for Bracket Mapping: This map will help us quickly check if a bracket is an opening or closing one and what type it is.
Iterate Through the String: Go through each character in the string.
Process Each Bracket:
If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
If it's a closing bracket, check the stack:
If the stack is empty, or the bracket at the top of the stack doesn't match the closing bracket, return False.
Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.
Check the Stack at the End: If the stack is empty, all brackets were properly closed and matched, so return True. Otherwise, return False.
Python Implementation
Here's how you can implement this in Python:

python
Copy code
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        bracket_map = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}

        for char in s:
            if char in bracket_map.values():
                stack.append(char)
            elif char in bracket_map:
                if stack and stack[-1] == bracket_map[char]:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                return False  # Invalid character

        return not stack  # True if stack is empty, False otherwise
Step-by-Step for Example Inputs
Input: s = "()"

Iterate: ( is an opening bracket, add to stack → Stack: ["("]
Iterate: ) is a closing bracket, matches top of stack, pop ( → Stack: []
End: Stack is empty, return True.
Input: s = "()[]{}"

Similar steps as above, each opening bracket is matched with its closing counterpart.
End: Stack is empty, return True.
Input: s = "(]"

Iterate: ( is an opening bracket, add to stack → Stack: ["("]
Iterate: ] is a closing bracket, doesn't match top of stack, return False.
This solution is efficient and straightforward, utilizing the stack's properties to ensure that the brackets are valid and in the correct order.

Sure, let's walk through the steps of the algorithm using the input s = "()[]{}":

Step-by-Step Process
Create a Stack:

We start with an empty stack: []
Create a Hash Map for Bracket Mapping:

We define a hash map (dictionary in Python) to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket: {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
Iterate Through the String s = "()[]{}":

The string is iterated character by character.
Process Each Bracket:

First Character: ( is an opening bracket.
Push onto stack → Stack: ["("]
Second Character: ) is a closing bracket.
Check stack: Top is ( which matches with ).
Pop the top element → Stack: []
Third Character: [ is an opening bracket.
Push onto stack → Stack: ["["]
Fourth Character: ] is a closing bracket.
Check stack: Top is [ which matches with ].
Pop the top element → Stack: []
Fifth Character: { is an opening bracket.
Push onto stack → Stack: ["{"]
Sixth Character: } is a closing bracket.
Check stack: Top is { which matches with }.
Pop the top element → Stack: []
Check the Stack at the End:

At the end of the iteration, the stack is empty. This means all opening brackets were properly closed in the correct order.
Since the stack is empty, return True.
Conclusion
For the input s = "()[]{}", every opening bracket in the string finds its correct matching closing bracket in the proper order. The stack helps us to track the most recent opening bracket and ensures that each closing bracket corresponds to the right opening one. The stack ends up empty, indicating that the string of brackets is valid, so the algorithm returns True.

Algorithm
Create an Empty String r: This will hold the normalized version of the input string s.
Iterate Over Each Character in s:
Check if the Character is Alphanumeric: Using i.isalnum(), which checks if i is either a letter or a number.
Append Alphanumeric Characters to r: If the character is alphanumeric, it's added to r.
Convert r to Lowercase: This ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
Check if r is a Palindrome:
Compare r with its reverse (r[::-1]). In Python, [::-1] is used to create a reversed copy of the string.
If r is the same as r[::-1], return True. Otherwise, return False.
Data Structure
String (r): The primary data structure used here is a string. You create a new string r to store the filtered and normalized version of the input string s.
Example with Input
Let's apply this algorithm to an example input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama".

Create an Empty String r: r = "".
Iterate and Append Alphanumeric Characters:
After iterating through s, and appending alphanumeric characters, r becomes "AmanaplanacanalPanama".
Convert to Lowercase:
r becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama".
Check if r is a Palindrome:
r is "amanaplanacanalpanama" and r[::-1] is also "amanaplanacanalpanama".
Since they are the same, return True.
Your approach efficiently processes the string and checks for the palindrome condition. The use of string operations and conditional checks makes it a straightforward and effective solution for this problem.
